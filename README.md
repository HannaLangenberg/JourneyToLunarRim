# JourneyToLunarRim
A project from wintersemester 2021 using Unity and C#.
<br/>_This being said: Please <b>do not clone</b> this repository._
 
## The Application
A VR space explorer game for Android and the GoogleCardboard. This is a showcase, the actual repository is hosted by a teammate.

 ### The UI
In the main menu the user can directly start the first level, enter the chapter selection or change settings.

</p>
In the settings the volume of the music and sound effects can be tweaked and in the chapter selection each artifact displays some information about itself when looked at.

While the game is loading a loading screen informs the user about the current progress.

### In-Game
To make the journey more immersive, the user takes the role of Prof. Atlas and communicates with a scientist, Freya Core, and a minister, Chad Baker. They inform Prof. Altlas about their mission / backstory and help reach the next level.

</p>
The spaceshuttle flies on its own at a constant speed. The direction is determined by the user's head rotaion.
<br/>There are three displays in the cockipt, left the fuel tank, right the shield and in the middle a wayfinding arrow to the level goal (the artifact).
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/HannaLangenberg/JourneyToLunarRim/blob/main/Pictures/InGame.PNG" width="550"></p>
There are three collectable energy spheres (fuel, shield and warp):
<ul>
 <li>The fuel tank continously emptys and Prof. Atlas has to collect the fuel sphere to fill it again.</li>
 <li>The shield breaks every time Prof. Atlas hits an asteroid. To repair the damage they have to collect the shield sphere.</li>
 <li>The arrow always looks right at the artifact. Prof. Atlas has to follow the directions to accomplish the mission.</li>
</ul>
<i>Pictures of energy spheres will follow.</i>

<br/>
<br/>If the fuel tank and / or the shield stats too low, a warning is displayed on the spaceshuttle's windows.

Once one of the stats is empty, the game is lost and Prof. Atlas has to option to try again or return to the menu.

If the mission is accomplished, Freya Core and Minister Baker transport them to the next level.
